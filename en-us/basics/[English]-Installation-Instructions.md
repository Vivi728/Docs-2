## Installing on Ubuntu

The Ubuntu runtime environment needs to meet the following requirements:
- System version: `Ubuntu 16.04.1 or above` 

There are four ways of installation on Ubuntu: 
- binaries package
- PPA source
- debian package
- source code

> ** Note **: When installing through official binary packages, PPA sources and Debian packages, the native CPU architectures need to be above 2.0 and 2.0, otherwise PlatON needs to be installed by compiling and encoding.


### Binary package based installation

Officially, two binary packages are available. Users can download and install them on demand. The download link is as follows:

- PlatON foundation package：<https://download.platon.network/0.5/platon-ubuntu-amd64-0.5.0.tar.gz>
- PlatON package with MPC and VC functions：<https://download.platon.network/0.5/platon-ubuntu-amd64-0.5.0-with-mv.tar.gz

1.Install PlatON Foundation Package

```bash
$ wget https://download.platon.network/0.5/platon-ubuntu-amd64-0.5.0.tar.gz

$ tar -xvzf platon-ubuntu-amd64-0.5.0.tar.gz
```

The extracted files should be as following:

- `platon` client executable file
- `ethkey` key generator
- `ctool`  wasm contract deploy kit

2.Install PlatON with MPC and VC functions

> Note：
>1. All official binary packages with MPC function only support CPU architecture of 2.0 and above. If the native CPU architecture needs to compile source code by itself under 2.0, please refer to the compilation method [Compile PlatON client with MPC function](#)

> 2. Before installing all binary packages with MPC functions, you need to install the dependency libraries of MPC VM and configure environment variables. The download link of the dependency libraries is <https://download.platon.network/0.5/platon-mpclib-ubuntu-amd64-0.5.0.tar.gz>.

> 3. Dependencies need to be installed before installing all binary packages with VC functions.

- Install `MPC VM` Library

```bash
# download the mpc lib 
$ wget https://download.platon.network/0.5/platon-mpclib-ubuntu-amd64-0.5.0.tar.gz

# decompressed
$ tar -xvzf platon-mpclib-ubuntu-amd64-0.5.0.tar.gz
```

Add the decompressed path to the environment variable:

```bash
$ grep "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/home/path/to/platon-mpclib-ubuntu-amd64-0.5.0" ~/.bashrc || echo "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/home/path/to/platon-mpclib-ubuntu-amd64-0.5.0" >> ~/.bashrc

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/home/path/to/platon-mpclib-ubuntu-amd64-0.5.0
```

- Install `VC` Library

```
$ sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev 
$ sudo apt-get install llvm-6.0-dev llvm-6.0 libclang-6.0-dev 
$ sudo apt-get install libgmpxx4ldbl libgmp-dev libprocps4-dev libssl-dev
```

- Install PlatON：

```bash
# download
$ wget https://download.platon.network/0.5/platon-ubuntu-amd64-0.5.0-with-mv.tar.gz
$ tar -xvzf platon-ubuntu-amd64-0.5.0-with-mv.tar.gz
```

$ wget https://download.platon.network/0.5/platon-all-ubuntu-amd64-0.5.0.deb

$ sudo dpkg -i platon-all-ubuntu-amd64-0.5.0.deb
```

After the installation, the binaries and other components of the package should be installed to `/usr/bin/`

### Source code based installation

The Ubuntu build environment needs to meet the following requirements:
- System version: `Ubuntu 16.04.1 or above`
- git：`2.19.1 or above`
- Compiler: `gcc(4.9.2+)`
- go language development kit: `go(1.7+)`

>**Note**: Make sure the compilation environment requirements are met！

The PlatON compilation and installation process is as follows:

#### 1. Clone `platon` source code to local target folder:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/PlatONnetwork/PlatON-Go.git --recursive
```

#### 2. Compilation

##### Compiling `Platon` without `MPC` capability by default

```bash
$ cd PlatON-Go
$ find ./build -name "*.sh" -exec chmod u+x {} \;
$ make all
```

##### Compiling `Platon` with `MPC` capability 

To enable `MPC` function on `platon`, compile `MPC VM` module and link it to the platon. Steps are as follows:

- Compiling `MPC VM`

Please referring to [Privacy Contract VM Compilation](https://github.com/PlatONnetwork/privacy-contract-vm#building--installing).
Assuming that the compilation directory is `home/path/to/mpcvm/build`, the compilation will output the `MPC VM` runtime libraries to `home/path/to/mpcvm/build/lib`.

- Setup environment

Append the compiled `MPC VM` libraries path `~/home/path/to/mpcvm/build/lib` to current user libraries environment variable:

```bash
$ grep "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/home/path/to/mpcvm/build/lib" ~/.bashrc || echo "export  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/home/path/to/mpcvm/build/lib" >> ~/.bashrc

& export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/home/path/to/mpcvm/build/lib
```

- Compiling `platon`

```bash
$ cd PlatON-Go
$ find ./build -name "*.sh" -exec chmod u+x {} \;
$ make all-with-mpc
```
After compilation, the `platon`、 `ethkey` and `ctool` executable files will be generated in the `PlatON-Go/build/bin` directory，and then copy these executable files to your own working directory.

>**Hint**：
>MPC is secure multi-party computing feature supported by the Platon platform for privacy calculations. **Only Ubuntu supported now**. For more information about MPC, please refer [Reference](en-us/development/%5BEnglish%5D-PlatON-Privacy-Contract-Guide)

##### Compiling `Platon` with `VC` capability 

- Compiling `platon`

```bash
$ cd PlatON-Go
$ find ./build/ -name "*.sh" -exec chmod u+x {} \;
$ make all-with-vc
```

After compilation, the `platon`、 `ethkey` and `ctool` executable files will be generated in the `PlatON-Go/build/bin` directory，and then copy these executable files to your own working directory.

>**Hint**：`VC` is the infrastructure of PlatON Platform for Validation Computing, please refer[Reference](en-us/development/[English]-Verifiable-Contract)

##### Compiling `Platon` with `MPC` and `VC` capability 

>**Note**: Before compiling PlatON, you need to install `MPC VM`dependencies. Refer to [Compile MPC VM]( Compiling `Platon` with `MPC`capability).

```bash
$ cd PlatON-Go
$ find ./build/ -name "*.sh" -exec chmod u+x {} \;
$ make all-with-mv
```

After compilation, the `platon`、 `ethkey` and `ctool` executable files will be generated in the `PlatON-Go/build/bin` directory，and then copy these executable files to your own working directory.

## Installing on Windows

The Windows environment supports three installation modes:
- Binary package
- Chocolatey installation
- source code


> **Note**：When installing through official binary packages and Chocolate, the native CPU architectures need to be above 2.0 and 2.0, otherwise PlatON needs to be installed by compiling and encoding.

### Binary package based installation

Windows version of the Platon binary download link is: <https://download.platon.network/0.5/platon-windows-x86_64-0.5.0.zip> download. No installation is required after downloading, and it can be used directly by decompression.

The `PlatON'binary download links for Windows versions are as follows:

- PlatON Foundation Package：<https://download.platon.network/0.5/platon-windows-x86_64-0.5.0.zip>
- PlatON package with MPC and VC functions：<https://download.platon.network/0.5/platon-windows-x86_64-0.5.0-with-mv.zip>

 No installation is required after downloading, and it can be used directly by decompression. 

The extracted files should be as following:
- `platon` client executable file
- `ethkey` key generator
- `ctool`  wasm contract deploy kit

> **Note**:If MPC functions are required, the relevant dependencies need to be installed in the following ways:

Download the dependency packages：<https://download.platon.network/0.5/platon-mpclib-windows-x86_x64-0.5.0.zip>，decompress the file and configure the environment variable，If the decompressed path is：D:/platon/mpclib/，the added environment variable is:
 
 ```
 LD_LIBRARY_PATH = D:/platon/mpclib/
 ```

### Installation via Chocolatey

We use the Chocolatey package manager to install the required build tools. If you don't have Chocolatey, follow the instructions on <https://chocolatey.org>.

Start PowerShell as an administrator and install Platon using the choco command:

1.Install PlatON Foundation Package

Start PowerShell as an administrator and install platonnetwork：

```
> choco install platonnetwork --version=0.5.0
```

2.Install PlatON with MPC and VC functions

Start PowerShell as an administrator and install platonnetwork-all：

```
> choco install platonnetwork-all --version=0.5.0
```

After complation, you will find `platon`,`ethkey` in the default installation path `C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin`.

### Source code based installation

The Windows build environment requires:
- git:`2.19.1`
- go language development kit: `go(1.11+)`
- mingw: `mingw(V6.0.0)`

> Note: You can install the above compilation environment by yourself. Before compiling the `Platon` source code, make sure that the above environment works properly. The `chocolatey` installation can also be used, referring to the following ways:


#### 1. Install compilation environment

Start PowerShell as an administrator and install Platon using the choco command:

```
// install git
choco install git
// install golang
choco install golang
// install mingw
choco install mingw
```

Most of the software installed with the Chocolatey package manager use the default installation path, although some publishers override the default settings in their software. Installing these packages will modify the PATH environment variable. The final installation path can be found in PATH. 

#### 2. Get `PlatON` source code

Create `src/github.com/PlatONnetwork/` and `bin` directories under the current `%GOPATH%` directory and clone the source code of `PlatON-GO` under the `PlatONnetwork` directory:

```
> git clone https://github.com/PlatONnetwork/PlatON-Go.git --recursive
```

#### 3. Compile

Before compiling the project, we need to run the following scripts in the `PlatON-GO` directory to compile the lib libraries, and the script needs to be executed in the bash environment:

```
> ./build/build_deps.sh
```

Then executing different compilation commands under the source directory `PlatON-GO` can generate executable files with different functions, as follows:

1.Compiling PlatON Foundation Package

```
> go run build/ci.go install ./cmd/platon
```

2.Compiling PlatON with MPC function

```
> go run build/ci.go install -mpc on ./cmd/platon
```

2.Compiling PlatON with VC function

```
> go run build/ci.go install -vc on ./cmd/platon
```

3.Compiling PlatON with MPC and VC functions

```
> go run build/ci.go install -mv on ./cmd/platon
```

After compilation, the `platon`、 `ethkey` and `ctool` executable files will be generated in the `PlatON-Go/build/bin` directory，and then copy these executable files to your own working directory.


## Running in Docker Environment

#### Install docker

The docker installation is relatively simple, you can refer to the following two ways to install:

- Installation from [Aliyun image](https://yq.aliyun.com/articles/110806)
- Installation From [Docker's official image](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)

#### Run Container

- Pull Platon Image

```bash
$ sudo docker pull platonnetwork/platon:tag #e.g: platonnetwork/platon:0.5.0
```

- Run Platon Container

Start the `Platon` node in the container by executing the following commands. The default RPC port is 6789 and the P2P port is 16789:

```bash
$ sudo docker run -d platonnetwork/platon:tag
```

To open port mapping, execute the following commands:

```bash
$ sudo docker run -d -e PLATONIP="192.168.120.20" -p 6789:6789  -p 16789:16789 --name platon platonnetwork/platon:0.5.0
```

`PLATONIP`is the local server address.

Execute the following commands to enter the container:

```bash
$ sudo docker exec -it container_name bash #container_name is the container name or id.
```

Execute a command to enter the platform's JS terminal(The default directory is under /opt/node when you enter the container):

```bash
# platon attach ipc:./data/platon.ipc
```

Note: If not enable port mapping, you can only enter into the JS terminal through the above commands in the container. After opening the port mapping, you can enter the JS terminal locally through the following commands:

```bash
# platon attach http://PLATONIP:6789
```

Start and stop the platform service in the container using the following commands:

```bash
# supervisorctl start platon 
# supervisorctl stop platon 
# supervisorctl restart platon 
```

If the above command is invalid, use the following command：

```bash
# /etc/init.d/supervisor stop
# /etc/init.d/supervisor start
```

** Note: The data directory of Platon in the container is located in `opt/node` directory. By default, the system has only one wallet account, and the password is 123456**.
